Hi! My name is Lara. I study Biology at the university of Mons and this is my blog.

I am a curious person. I am interested in animals and the environment but not only! I also like to discover new things about all kind of  scientific subjects but also cultural and historical thingies. I like reading, listening to music, watching videos or doing a bunch of other stuff during my free time.

I don't know yet what I want to do later but I dream of travel and adventure.

This blog is one of my projects and I hope it'll be interesting for you, my muchochos!!
