*General topic*       |The impact of climate change on butterflies species and temperature.
*What was examined?*  |We now know that some butterfly species can control their body temperature more easily than others by reflecting the sun’s rays. They are ectotherms. Some butterfly species are adapted to places where the temperature variation is not too great, which allows them to better regulate theirs and survive: a micro-climate. Various causes cause the disappearance of these micro-climates and, with them,the decline of the species that inhabit them. However, climate change is worsening the situation. The researchers looked at the impact of these large temperature variations and the more extreme weather caused by climate change on butterflies by studying their body temperature.
*Conclusion*       |Butterflies are important because they are pollinators like bees but they are also a source of food for many other animals. Their decline therefore causes an imbalance within our ecosystem. The study showed that many species no longer agree with their microclimate in terms of temperature. To protect them, it is therefore important to preserve their habitats but also and especially their temperature.
