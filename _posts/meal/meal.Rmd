* **September**

I started "Wallangues" at the beginning of the month to work my English. I also watched videos in English on YouTube and downloaded the "Lyrics Training" app which I find very funny to the point of not seeing the time go by. As for my lessons, I regularly work on the different subjects. 

* **October** 

My main activities in English for this month were my classes as well as the creation of my blog and first article. I also watched some videos, sometimes documentaries, in English and started the British series *Luther* during my free time. This is a police series that follows the story of John Luther, a policeman from the criminal section of London. 

* **November** 

To diversify my activities in English while continuing to work on my classes and blog, I started reading the first volume of the famous Harry Potter saga in English. I also continued to use Lyrics Training and watch videos and series according to my "desires" of the moment. I dropped out of my police series to watch something that is more related to the history of England that I am very attracted to.
