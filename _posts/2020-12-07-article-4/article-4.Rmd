*Researchers*         |University of Helsinki, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Professor Tomas Roslin, Tuomas Kankaanpää 
*Published in / when* |September 11, 2020 on Science News
*General topic*       |Impact of climate change on a big predator of the Arctic: parasitoides
*What was examined?*  |The Arctic is the best place, according to the researchers, to study the impact of climate change since the climate is relatively cold and the summer periods are very small. The organisms that live there are therefore more sensitive to the slightest change in their environment. This study was conducted on a large group of predators that are parasites. They are more or less impacted by this change depending on their lifestyle through their hosts because parasites use different hosts to reproduce and develop or feed.
*Conclusion*       |The impact of climate change on different hosts affects the parasites that use them to live. These are classified into different groups according to their lifestyle and therefore how they are impacted. For the study, the researchers used a climate change sensitivity barometer that allowed them to develop several solutions. To do this, researchers have to work in collaboration with other scientists for practical, economic and other purposes. Parasites are important organisms to our ecosystem, so it is important to preserve them.
