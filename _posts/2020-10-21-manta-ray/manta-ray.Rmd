# Description 


The manta ray, also called devil of the seas, is one of the largest animals of the planet with nearly 6 meters of span and almost 2 tons. It has an extended flat body with two pairs of fins:

* *Pectoral fins*: They are placed on both sides of the main body. These are reminiscent of a pair of wings that allows the animal to swim and head into the ocean like a bird in the areas.

* *Head fins*: These are pectoral fin extentions on each side of the flat head. These limbs are used to help the animal progress through the water and allow it to swim faster. It uses these limbs to bring water to the gills by concentrating it towards the mouth and also to feed itself.

The manta ray is a fish called **cartilaginous**, that is to say it has a cartilage skeleton and therefore quite soft. Its gill slits are placed below the animal on its belly and its eyes are placed on either side of the head above the head fins.
It has a small spineless tail and its body is dark blue-grey and white (mainly on the belly and tip of the wings).

## Lifestyle and Habitat:

Manta rays are found mainly in the **warm waters** of the tropics **at reef level**, in shallow waters. However, at the time of reproduction, they can move gently from the coasts. They are also sometimes found in more temperate waters. They can also migrate, while remaining close to their habitat, to find areas where food is more abundant.

### Food:

They feed mainly on **plankton** and other microorganisms as well as small fish. As mentioned above, the food is directed to the mouth wide open via the cephalic fins.

### Reproduction:

During the breeding season, we have that the skate migrates closer to the coast in order to find a partner.
Note that the skate has a row of teeth that is used by the male to hook the female during mating and not to chew food.

After fertilization, the female makes eggs (usually 2) which will remain inside the uterus after hatching and which will feed on their energy reserve: the vitellus. The animal is therefore **ovivipare**. The gestation period is about 1 year and once well developed, the young are released into the ocean, they have several kilos and measure nearly one meter. The sexual maturity of an individual comes after almost 15 years and we have, on average, one birth every 5 or 6 years.

Today we know that the Manta Ray **can live up to 50 years**.


Additional note: The line has electro receptors that allow them to orient themselves, to find their prey and their potential partner.
