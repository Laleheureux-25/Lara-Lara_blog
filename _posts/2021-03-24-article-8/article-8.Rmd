## **Analysis table**

**Analysis points**   |
----------------------|-------------------------------------------------
*Researchers*         |Peter Ungar (leader), Alexandria Peterson, Blaire Van Valkenburgh, Dorothee Ehrich, Oliver Gilg, Alexandra Terekhina, Alexander Volkovitskiy, Aleksandr Sokolov, Natalia Sokolova, Ivan Fufachev and Viktor Shtro.
*Published in / when* |March 16, 2021 on the University of Arkansas website.
*General topic*       |Study of climate change in arctic regions through the dentition of polar fox.
*What was examined?*  |The aim of the research was to analyze the diet of polar foxes through the analysis of the different splinters and usures of their teeth. Using this data, the researchers were able to see indirectly the effects of climate change at different times at the Arctic Circle level on the more sensitive animals in this diet. Indeed, the diet analyzed over a long period makes it possible to understand the different adaptations of the fox in order to find food according to the abundance of prey, the seasons but also the climate. The studies are carried out on nearly 78 individuals in the Arctic North and more precisely on the different marks by the bones of their prey on their teeth.
*Conclusion*          |The different data were able to accurately demonstrate the type of feeding of polar fox over the long term and in various regions. It has been proven that these animals adapt their diet according to the abundance of rodents present in relation to the regions. Thanks to this, the researchers were able to define the negative impact of climate change and therefore environmental change on the abundance  of animals and the adaptation of polar foxes.
